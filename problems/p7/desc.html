<p>
Submit a write-up for this project in PDF. You should include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the problem and the algorithms used in the problems (culminating in the solution in Problem 6).</li>
<li>Run the solver you developed on different types of puzzles and measure how the solution time varies with the board size and difficulty ratings. Show your results in two separate graphs (one for the board size and another for the difficulty rating). Summarize your finding in a paragraph.</li>
<li>Extra credit: You may also analyze the effect of each type of heuristics (inference, variable and value ordering). Compared to the basic solver in p3, how much does each type of heuristic speed up the solver for this problem?</li>
<li>A paragraph from each author stating what their contribution was and what they learned.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your writeup should be structured as a formal report, and we will grade based on the quality of the writeup, including structure and clarity of explanations.
